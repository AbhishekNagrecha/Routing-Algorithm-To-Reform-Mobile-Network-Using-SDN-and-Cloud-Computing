# Routing-Algorithm-To-Reform-Mobile-Network-Using-SDN-and-Cloud-Computing

 In this project I used SDN-based architecture with cloud computing to ease steering traffic flows in a cellular network that will maximize the total amount of traffic accepted over time. 

Simulation showed that PdCsp outperformed other alternative algorithms under considerations of NE density, latency, budget constraints, congestion control and reliability, hence better data speed and improved QoS.

Results also show that due to end-to-end optimization, congestion / budget awareness, and primal-dual approximation, algorithm significantly outperforms prevalent heuristics.
